# OpenControl Pipelines

Continuous Authorization pipelines can be constructed using the
open source [Concourse CI](https://Concourse.ci) tool.

The [example pipeline is available on github.](https://github.com/opencontrol/example-pipelines)

## Key Tools

* [Compliance Masonry](https://github.com/opencontrol/compliance-masonry)
* [ComplianceLib](https://github.com/govready/compliancelib-python) — Most existing certifications are documented in XML, and ComplianceLib transforms these into YAML.
